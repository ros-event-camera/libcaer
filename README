libcaer
====

Minimal C library to access, configure and get data from neuromorphic sensors and processors.
Currently supported devices are the Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS), the DAVIS cameras, and the
Dynap-SE neuromorphic processor.

REQUIREMENTS:

Linux, MacOS X or Windows (for Windows build instructions see README.Windows)
pkg-config
cmake >= 3.10.0
gcc >= 4.9 or clang >= 3.6
libusb >= 1.0.17
Optional: libserialport >= 0.1.1
Optional: OpenCV >= 3.1.0

Please make sure that you have the various development packages installed
for the above dependencies. They are usually called PKG-dev or PKG-devel.

On Fedora Linux: $ sudo dnf install @c-development cmake pkgconfig libusbx-devel
On Ubuntu Linux: $ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake pkg-config libusb-1.0-0-dev
On MacOS X (using Homebrew): $ brew install cmake pkg-config libusb

INSTALLATION:

1) configure:

$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr .
Optional: add -DENABLE_SERIALDEV=1 to enable support for serial port devices,
such as the eDVS4337, via libserialport.
Optional: add -DENABLE_OPENCV=1 to enable better support for frame enhancement
(demoisaicing for color, contrast, white-balance) via OpenCV.

2) build:

$ make

3) install:

$ sudo make install

DOCUMENTATION:

Online HTML documentation is available at https://inivation.gitlab.io/dv/libcaer/
Also check the examples/ directory and the iniVation Support website.

USAGE:

See the examples/ directory. Each example shows minimal working code
to connect to a device and print out data coming from it. To compile
the examples, see 'examples/README' for the build commands.

General usage follows this pattern (simplified):

h = caerDeviceOpen(TYPE);
caerDeviceSendDefaultConfig(h);
caerDeviceDataStart(h);

loop:
	c = caerDeviceDataGet(h);
	work with c (container) and its event packets

caerDeviceDataStop(h);
caerDeviceClose(&h);

All configuration parameters and event types are specified in the
public headers and documented there.
